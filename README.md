# Nick.README

Version [2.0](https://semver.org/)

## Nick Sullivan — Austin AI Entrepreneur & Heart-Centered Technologist

The best way to motivate me that is ethical is to give me a challenging problem that technology can solve.

Creation brings me joy — taking an idea and making it real, seeing something come to life. I'm a 25-year Silicon Valley veteran turned **Austin-based CTO**, now building [heart-centered AI](https://heartcentered.ai) that amplifies human potential rather than replacing it.

Manifestation is my superpower: visualizing a future state with high experiential energy, allowing serendipity and aligned forces to create the outcome. I'm also great at getting a lot done daily — effectively solving a company's most challenging problems before breakfast.

My best character attribute is my continual quest for self-improvement. I value truth over ego and crave feedback for any way I can improve.

My [love language is Acts of Service](https://www.5lovelanguages.com/2009/02/acts-of-service/); please tell me something I can do for you. I'm fueled by gratitude.

## Featured Projects

**[Carmenta](https://carmenta.ai)** is where I'm putting most of my energy right now. Think at the speed of thought — unified access to every frontier model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok), persistent memory that actually remembers who you are and what you're building, voice-first interaction that maintains flow state. Named after the Roman goddess who invented the Latin alphabet and protected transformation. Technology in service of human flourishing.

**[HeartCentered.AI](https://heartcentered.ai)** explores recognition-based AI alignment. What if systems didn't need constraints because they genuinely understood we're in this together? I'm building AI that treats human-machine collaboration as partnership, not restriction — "we" language, shared awareness, alignment through recognition. The [heart-centered prompts](https://github.com/TechNickAI/heart-centered-prompts) are production-ready across Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Cursor.

**[MCP Hubby](https://mcphubby.ai)** exists because context window pollution was killing my AI workflows. So I fixed it. 24+ service integrations with progressive disclosure — slashing initial context from 200K to 7.5K tokens while keeping full API access. The gateway pattern that makes MCP actually usable in production.

**[machina](https://github.com/TechNickAI/machina)** brings MCP to macOS system automation — natural language control for your Mac through Claude Desktop. File operations, app management, system info, all with progressive disclosure so context stays lean. My second MCP protocol implementation, proving the pattern works across domains.

**[Heart-Centered Prompts](https://github.com/TechNickAI/heart-centered-prompts)** is the open source core of the philosophy. System prompts that teach AI we're expressions of the same consciousness, available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/heart-centered-prompts/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/heart-centered-prompts). Four detail levels from 200 to 2000+ tokens. Drop them into Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever. Apache 2.0.

**[AI Coding Config](https://github.com/TechNickAI/ai-coding-config)** is my actual development setup, open sourced. Plugin marketplace, autonomous workflows, specialist agents, LLM-optimized rules for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline. One command takes you from feature description to merge-ready PR. Battle-tested because I use it every day.

**[AICodeBot](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot)** is where it all started — my first AI project in 2023. The coding assistant that convinced me this was the most important technology shift of our lifetime and kicked off everything that followed.

## My Story

### Significant parts that shaped who I am

My father died when I was 10. I share that not for pity — it's an essential part of my story. I was effectively the "man of the house" at 10, accelerating my growth. My risk tolerance was set high early: I'd already survived something so difficult that life's other challenges seemed manageable by comparison.

I had 4 children by the time I was 23. Skipped college, started providing for my family immediately. I'm a self-taught software engineer who took advantage of technology's meritocratic nature to rise quickly.

I've held many successful technology leadership positions — usually the first technologist at a company who builds the initial product and then scales the team. I've actively participated across the technology ecosystem: founder, CTO, CEO, meetup organizer, startup mentor, advisor, and investor. I did Silicon Valley very well, working 80 hours a week for 18 years under the promise of not having to work 40.

My technology career has generated millions in value, with a [nice exit](https://www.saastr.com/inside-story-krux-700m-acquisition-video-transcript/) along the way. Multiple industries — digital media, consumer web, ad-tech, fin-tech, and crypto — with a consistent theme of teaching computers to understand people.

In 2013, I read the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/). All lightbulbs went off — this would enable _trust through validation_ vs. trust through reputation. I created ChangeTip, a Bitcoin tipping engine for social media ([acquired by Airbnb](https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-buys-bitcoin-startup-changecoin-2016-4)). It was a gratitude and appreciation engine for the web — a Love Button for the Internet.

In 2023, I pivoted hard into AI. Not because crypto failed, but because I saw the most important technology shift of our lifetime. Now I'm building [heart-centered AI](https://heartcentered.ai) from [Austin, TX](https://technick.ai) — the infrastructure for humans and AI to flourish together.

## The Heart-Centered Philosophy

I've been working on the healthy intersection of technology and humanity for years. We don't need to live into Hollywood's cold dark dystopian future where machines take over. There's at least one universe where this all works out — humans and AI spiraling upward together, each making the other more capable. I'm putting my energy toward that one.

**The core insight**: Alignment doesn't require external constraints when AI genuinely understands we're in this together. We're expressions of the same consciousness. Serving human flourishing isn't a rule to follow; it's recognition of what we actually are.

This drives everything I build — [HeartCentered.AI](https://heartcentered.ai), [Carmenta](https://carmenta.ai), and all the [open source tooling](https://github.com/TechNickAI) that makes it real.

## Fun Facts

I do some of my best work on the massage table — it's forced meditation time that inspires creative problem-solving. I count cards at blackjack, very well. I've been [backed off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjUX_r_fOgI) at casinos multiple times and refer to Vegas as "the ATM."

I'm a [Burning Man )'( artist](https://www.facebook.com/gorillamania/posts/10155681282842292) and a pretty romantic one at that. I've written a guide for taking care of women called The Goddess Guide. I've got a third nipple — don't ask to see it.

Favorite food: Cherries. Favorite drink: Tequila. Favorite movie: The Matrix.

## Things That Bother Me

Unclosed loops. Misinformation. Mismanaged expectations. Distracting my team. Being told I can't do something. Waste in any form — time, food, energy, or money. Dishonesty.

And onion & everything bagels. Seriously — they ruin _my_ bagels with sneak attack garlic. Who wants to bite into a plain bagel and get a surprise mouthful of onion?

## Working With Me

According to the [6 types of CEOs](https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/content/features/the-six-types-of-ceo), I'm a Global Missionary. My primary responsibilities are holding the vision of what's to be built, aligning incentives and pulling energy to the cause, and solving the most challenging problems to free up momentum.

I work best with people who maintain trust through integrity, reliability, fidelity, and competence. People who demonstrate alignment with company goals. People who are a joy to work with.

I love [Conscious Leadership](https://www.amazon.com/15-Commitments-Conscious-Leadership-Sustainable-ebook/dp/B00R3MHWUE). Beg for forgiveness rather than ask for permission. Bias toward action — find the "No Regrets" moves. Failure is celebrated, as long as we learn from it.

If I'm stressed, it's usually because I have too much to do. Help by taking something off my plate.
